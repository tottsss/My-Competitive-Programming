# Erdős–Gallai theorem

A sequence of non-negative integers $d_{1}\geq \cdots \geq d_{n}$( $d_1\geq\cdots\geq d_n$) can be represented as the degree sequence of a finite simple graph on n vertices if and only if $d_{1}+\cdots +d_{n}$ is even and

$$\sum _{i=1}^{k}d_{i}\leq k(k-1)+\sum _{i=k+1}^{n}\min(d_{i},k)$$

holds for every k in $1\leq k\leq n$
